# Scenario Generator Guidelines - Airline

These guidelines help the scenario generator create valid, solvable scenarios for the airline environment.

## Tool Limitations & Constraints

Add specific constraints about what scenarios are possible given the available tools:

<!-- Example constraints (customize based on your tools):
- Cannot change flights within 24 hours of departure
- Refunds only available for refundable tickets
- Seat upgrades depend on availability
- Name changes have strict limitations
-->

## Valid Scenario Types

List the types of scenarios that should be generated:

<!-- Example:
- Flight rebooking (with valid alternative flights)
- Seat selection changes
- Baggage inquiries
- Check-in assistance
- Flight status inquiries
- Cancellation requests (for eligible tickets)
-->

## Scenarios to Avoid

List scenarios that should NOT be generated due to tool limitations:

<!-- Example:
- Changes to non-changeable tickets
- Refunds for non-refundable fares
- Complex multi-leg itinerary changes
- Partner airline modifications
-->

## Data Requirements

Specify any data requirements for generated scenarios:

<!-- Example:
- All flights must have valid departure/arrival times
- Passenger names must match reservation
- Seat assignments must be valid for aircraft type
-->

## Additional Notes

Add any other guidelines that help create realistic, solvable scenarios.
